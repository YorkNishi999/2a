==> 1.desc <== -> pass 3/3
xv6 compiles and boots up correctly. 

==> 2.desc <==
Test getpinfo() when pstat is valid. 

==> 3.desc <== -> pass 3/3
Test if settickets() correctly sets the number of tickets

==> 4.desc <==
Test srand(), and test setticket(), and getpinfo() with invalid arguments

==> 5.desc <== -> pass 3/3
Test if tickets are initialized correctly

==> 6.desc <==
Test if processes have runticks proportional to their tickets

==> 7.desc <==
Test if the lottery scheduler prevents starvation

==> 8.desc <==
Test if processes actually runs for number of ticks proportional to their tickets

----------------part 2---------------

==> 9.desc <==
Test if the waiting processes are given the correct number of boost ticks

==> 10.desc <==
Test if the child process is correctly initialized when the parent is boosted

==> 11.desc <==
Test if sleeping processes are given the correct amount of boost ticks: this requires improving the sleep/wake mechanism

==> 12.desc <==
Test if a process on boost as more runticks than another process with the same number of tickets

==> 13.desc <==
Test if a process on boost actually runs for ticks proportional to double of its base number of tickets

==> 14.desc <==
Test with multiple processes
